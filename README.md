<b>Overview</b>

Applying smart contract logic in music. Nowadays it is common for platforms to host music from artists where the visitor can buy any track they like for their own personal usage. Most of those sites work with either a bank transaction or paypal. However, for this project the goal is to rely on smart contracts in order to collect the payments.

<b>Goals</b>

Create a decentralized spotify where each time a customer gets one song from the playlist provided, in order to  use it on his own remix, the site gets paid.
